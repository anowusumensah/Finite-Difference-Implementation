# Finite-Difference-Implementation
The code(bioelecProj.m) is an implementation of the a diffusion equation
using Finite difference method.This repository has the attached has the class project(.pdf)

The objective of this project is to simulate the evolution of potential with respect to time of a 3cm x 3cm square piece of tissue using finite difference method. Finite difference method is used to approximate differential operator by substituting the derivatives in the equation using differential quotients. This method is utilized to find solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Obtaining a solution for a differential equation involves these 3 steps below;

1.	Solution region is first divided into grid of nodes.
2.	The given differential equation is then approximated by a differential equation that utilizes a finite difference equivalent that relates the dependent variable at a point in the grid to its neighboring points.
3.	The solution of the equation is obtained by subjecting the resulting equation to some given constraints or initial conditions.

The common methods are Explicit, Implicit and Crank Nicolson.
In this work, the solution of the electrical potentials of a square piece of tissue was obtained using explicit formulation. The resulting solution subjected to the given constraints was then simulated in MATLAB.
